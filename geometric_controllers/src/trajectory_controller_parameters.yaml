  joints:
    type: string_array
    default_value: ["x", "y", "z", "qx", "qy", "qz", "qw"]
    read_only: true
    description: >
      The list of position joints to use for the end effector position
      interfaces. This can be used to configure a prefix for the interfaces.
    validation:
      fixed_size<>: 7 # position + orientation (quaternion)

  path_tolerance:
    type: double
    default_value: 0.0
    read_only: true
    description: >
      The maximum error between the end effector pose and the reference
      pose in the trajectory.

      The error threshold is measured in terms of the squared norm of the
      geodesic distance between the end effector pose and the terminal pose in
      the trajectory.
    validation:
      gt_eq<>: 0.0

  goal_tolerance:
    type: double
    default_value: 0.0
    read_only: true
    description: >
      The maximum error between the end effector pose and the terminal
      pose in the trajectory at the end of execution.

      The error threshold is measured in terms of the squared norm of the
      geodesic distance between the end effector pose and the terminal pose in
      the trajectory.
    validation:
      gt_eq<>: 0.0

  use_external_measured_states:
    type: bool
    default_value: false
    read_only: true
    description: >
      Use end effector states provided via a topic instead of state interfaces
      or tf2. If both this and lookup_transform are set to true,
      the controller will use the end effector states provided via a topic.

  lookup_transform:
    type: bool
    default_value: false
    read_only: true
    description: >
      Use tf2 to look up the end effector transform instead of using state
      interfaces or a topic. This is useful in scenarios where the end effector
      state is determined only by using tf2 to perform forward kinematics.

      If both this and use_external_measured_states are set to true, the
      controller will use the end effector states provided via a topic.

  reference_controller:
    type: string
    default_value: ""
    read_only: true
    description: >
      The prefix of the reference controller to send commands to. This can be
      used to configure command interfaces in chained mode.

  parent_frame_id:
    type: string
    default_value: odom_ned
    read_only: true
    description: >
      The name of the inertial frame. This is used to lookup the end effector
      pose when using lookup_transform.

  child_frame_id:
    type: string
    default_value: tcp
    read_only: true
    description: >
      The name of the end effector frame. This is used to lookup the end
      effector pose when using lookup_transform.

  action_monitor_rate:
    type: int
    default_value: 20
    read_only: true
    description: >
      The rate (Hz) at which the action server will monitor the trajectory
      execution.
    validation:
      gt<>: 0
