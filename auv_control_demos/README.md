# AUV Control Demos

This package implements two examples that demonstrate how to use the controllers
in `auv_controllers`. The first example shows how to launch a single controller
on its own. The second example shows how to chain controllers together to
construct a cascading control architecture.

To read more about how to run these examples, please see the example READMEs:
